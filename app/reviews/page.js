                            "In summary, a fantastic experience! I know you don't normally get to say that when you are
                            dealing
                            with a company but it is true in this case.
                            Would I recommend Off Grid Power? Absolutely!
                            We had 38 panels, 2 inverters and a Tesla Powerwall 2 battery installed. From start to
                            finish the
                            process was painless, we were explained the timeline for our job and were kept up to date
                            throughout.
                            The technician that installed our hardware was phenomenal, polite, punctual and very
                            professional. Before he did a thing on the first day he came and spoke with us about the
                            work he
                            would be doing, also that he would keep any required disruption to our day minimal. Oh, did
                            I
                            mention that he cleaned up after himself as well? (Really, he did)."
